# COMPSCI-230-A2
This assignment is aimed at deepen users' understanding of object-oriented programming principles, utilize Java's graphics package for drawing shapes, and introduce basic event handling techniques. Through this project, users will gain practical experience in developing interactive graphical applications. The final program should achieve the following objectives:

Users can add new shapes by selecting the shape type, path type, and width from the Tools panel and clicking the Add button. 
Once a shape is added to the list, it starts moving. Each shape has its own special path and is labeled with a number that goes up in order.
Users have the ability to change the default width value. Upon modification, new shapes will be created based on the updated width value. In case of invalid inputs, such as negative or non-integer values, the program should reject the changes and revert to the original value displayed in the text field.
